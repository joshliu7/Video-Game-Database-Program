Our system has two types of users, administrators and regular users. Our system will allow for
users to search for games based on information such as title, genre, rating, or developer
company. Users must register by creating an account in order to login and access the database.
Users can rate games. Users can add a game to their favorites list and the system will create a
recommendation list for the user based on their favorites list. Users can also add a game to their
watch list so they can go back to it later. Users can directly access their watch list, favorites list,
or recommendations list. They can update their watch list or favorites list by adding games and
they can also delete games from these two lists. Administrators can do the same as a regular user
and also update information on games.
